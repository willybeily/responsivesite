      <p class="sectionsubtag">Tourism numbers declined as a result of a strong economic slowdown (the late-2000s recession) between the second half of 2008 and the end of 2009, and in consequence of the outbreak of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, but slowly recovered. Globally, international tourism receipts (the travel item in balance of payments
          grew to US$1.03 trillion (€740 billion) in 2005, corresponding to an increase in real terms of 3.8% from 2010.
           International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012,
            emerging source markets such as China, Russia, and Brazil had significantly increased their spending over the previous decade.</p><br>

      <p class="sectionsubtag">Tourism brings large amounts of income into a local economy in the form of payment for goods and
           services needed by tourists, accounting as of 2011 for 30% of the world's trade in services, and, as an invisible export, for 6% of 
           overall exports of goods and services. It also generates opportunities for employment in the service sector of the economy associated with
            tourism.</p><br>

      <p class="sectionsubtag">Modern tourism can be traced to what was known as the Grand Tour, which was a traditional trip around Europe 
          (especially Germany and Italy), undertaken by mainly upper-class European young men of means, mainly from Western and Northern 
          European countries. In 1624, young Prince of Poland, Ladislaus Sigismund Vasa, the eldest son of Sigismund III, embarked for a 
          journey across Europe, as was in custom among Polish nobility. He travelled through territories of today's Germany, Belgium, the 
          Netherlands, where he admired the Siege of Breda by Spanish forces, France, Switzerland to Italy, Austria, and the Czech Republic.
           It was an educational journey and one of the outcomes was introduction of Italian opera in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.</p><br>
